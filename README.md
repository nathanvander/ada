Ada Code

This has an SQLite driver, which is modified from GNATCOLL.SQL.Sqlite.Gnade available at https://github.com/AdaCore/gnatcoll.  This is very simple, but very powerful.  The Java driver sqlite4java is available at https://bitbucket.org/almworks/sqlite4java.  This can do most of what sqlite4java can do.  It is not fully tested.
